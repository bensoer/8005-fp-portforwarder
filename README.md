Created By Eric Tsang and Ben Soer

8005-fp-portforwarder is a Kotlin based Port Forwarding application that allows users to redirect UDP or TCP
traffic to a designated host on a specific IP. The project runs multi-threaded with a GUI allowing realtime
responsiveness to changes applied on port forwards. Additionaly the system monitors traffic quanities and
the number of connections made through the various ports that are forwarded. Users observing the GUI can
watch in real-time the amount of traffic passing through the Port Forwarder at any gvien time.
